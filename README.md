Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt




#ðŸŽ¯ Main Motive of the Project
The main goal of this project is to understand and demonstrate the power of deep learning using TensorFlow by building a real-world image classification model. Through the MNIST digit recognition task, the project aims to:

-Learn the Basics of TensorFlow & Keras
Get hands-on experience with the core tools and libraries used in modern machine learning and deep learning development.

-Understand CNN Architecture
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and understand how it can identify patterns in image data to classify handwritten digits.

-Preprocess and Work with Image Data
Learn how to load, normalize, and visualize datasets for training ML models.

-Train & Evaluate a Model
Apply best practices in training a model, evaluating its performance, and understanding accuracy metrics.

-Build a Complete Mini-Project
Create an end-to-end working project that showcases your ability to build AI-powered solutions, which can also be shared on platforms like GitHub or included in your portfolio.

##This project is educational, practical, and foundational â€” a great starting point for anyone moving into machine learning or AI development.
